# A Node.js Express / Redis Stack template on Gitpod

This is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) [Express](http://expressjs.com/) template configured for ephemeral development environments on [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) with [Redis Stack](https://redis.io/docs/stack/) using the [node-redis](https://github.com/redis/node-redis) client.

The application is a basic counter that stores a value in Redis in the `mycounter` key.

TODO pointer to the Python/Flask version.

## Getting up and Running

### Gitpod

Gitpod provides developer environments in the cloud, and links to your GitHub account.  You don't need to install anything on your machine, you'll work with the code using Redis and VSCode in a browser-based environment.  There's no charge to use it for up to 50 hours a month.  Click the button below to start a new development environment:
